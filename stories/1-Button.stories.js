    <p>The page has no css to organize and fit history and the page is not proportional to the width of the devices.</p>
    <p>The calculator don't show errors to the user</p>

    <p>The calculator has parentheses and they can typed in (2+3)(1/5) format;</p>
    <p>The input can be pasted and typed without the need to click on the buttons;</p>
    <p>Some simbols like âˆš and ^ can be quickly typed with the shortcuts r and t.</p>
